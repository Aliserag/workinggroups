# Flow's Core-Protocol Working Group

The **Core Protocol Working Group** [**CP-WG**] is an open-for-all forum with
a focus on Flow's future-proof architecture: efficiently scaling without compromising decentralization and composability

## Objective
In the CP-WG, we will align on priorities of planned features, define desired features, 
and iterate on the vision and roadmap for the development of Flow's underlying protocol.
A central objective is to facilitate alignment and cooperation of protocol contributors,
and to be an entry point for anyone wanting to familiarize themselves
with the inner working of flow's protocol and its evolution.

## Scope
Evolution of Flow to the mature protocol. This includes:
* Byzantine Fault Tolerance (autonomously detecting, handling and suppressing adversarial behaviour)
* Permissionless participation
* Protocol security and cryptography
* Zero-downtime protocol upgrades
* Trustless and open access to chain data
* Massive scaling while maintaining decentralization and smart contract composability

### Details

We use the [meetings](./meetings) folder,
to record our ongoing meetings. For each meeting, there is 
one markdown file in the format `<yyyy-mm-dd>_cp-wp_meeting<optional_details>.md`.
