# Flow Working Groups

Flow believes in the power of community-driven, collaborative problem-solving and is committed to involving this process in shaping its future.
To achieve this, Flow has established a series of Technical Working Groups, each dedicated to a crucial aspect of the Flow ecosystem.
The motivation is to harness the collective wisdom, insights, and expertise of the diverse Flow community to make informed decisions that align with the community's needs and the network's growth.

## Working groups

Flow has the following active working groups:

1. [Cadence Language Design Working Group](./cadence_language_design_working_group)
2. [Core Protocol Working Group](./core_protocol_working_group)
3. [Defi Working Group](./defi_working_group)
4. [Governance Working Group](./governance_working_group)
5. [User Experience Working Group](./user_experience_working_group)
6. [Wallet Working Group](./wallet_working_group)

These six groups cover all the major streams of work and a group can have sub-committees within it to focus on specific topics.

The working group goal is to drive their respective topic where members contribute towards ideation, research, designs and implementation of several initiatives under that topic.

> **Everyone** is invited to join these working groups as per their areas of interest.

Meeting cadence and agendas can be found in each of the respective sub-folders.
