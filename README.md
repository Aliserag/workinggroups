# Flow Working Groups

Flow believes in the power of community-driven, collaborative problem solving and is committed to involving this process in shaping its future.
To achieve this, Flow has established a series of Technical Working Groups, each dedicated to a crucial aspect of the Flow ecosystem.
The motivation is to harness the collective wisdom, insights, and expertise of the diverse Flow community to make informed decisions that align with the community's needs and the network's growth.
